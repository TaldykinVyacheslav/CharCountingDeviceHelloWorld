# device minor and major numbers:
# - major number indicating which device driver should be
# used to access a particular device
# - minor number serving as a flag to a device driver
# The minor number of the device node that represents the whole disk is 0.
# 12 bits are used to encode a major number (0..4095, it seems), 20 bits - for the minors
